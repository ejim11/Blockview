        If we assume that the WWW revolutionized information, and that the Web2
        revolutionized interactions, the Web3 has the potential to revo utionize
        agreements and value exchange. The Web3 changes the data structures in
        the backend of the Internet, introducing a universal state lager, often
        by incentivizing network actors with a token. The backbone of this Web3
        is represented by a series of blockchain networks or similar distributed
        ledgers.

        The Internet we have today is broken. We do not control our data, nor do
        we have a native value settlement laser. Thity years into miss adoption
        of the Internet, our data architectures are still based on the concept
        of the stand-alone computer, where data is centrally stored and managed
        on a server, and sent or retrieved by a client. Every time we interact
        over the Internet, copies of our data get sent to the server of a
        service provider, and every time that happens, we lose control over ou
        data. As a result, and even though we live in an increasingly connected
        world, our data is mostly centrally stored on local or remote servers,
        on our personal computers, mobile devices, flas i drives, and
        increasingly also on our watches, cars. TVs, or fridges. This raises
        issues of trust. Can I trust those people and institutions that store
        and manage my data against any form of corruption internally or
        externally, on purpose or by accident? Centralized data structures not
        only raise issues of security, privacy and control of personal data, but
        also produce many inefficiencies along the supply chain of goods and
        services

        The emergence of the WWW in the early 1990s increased the usability of
        the Internet with visually appealing and easy-to-navigate websites, Ten
        years later, the Internet became more mature, and programmable. We saw
        the rise of the so-called Web2, which brought us social media,
        e-commerce and knowledge platforms. The Web2 revolutionized social
        interactions, bringing producers and consumers of formation, goods, and
        services closer together. The Web2 allowed as to en oy peer-to-peer
        (P2P) interactions on a global scale, but always with a middleman: a
        platform acting as a trusted intermediary between two people who do not
        know or trust each other. While these Internet platforms have done a
        fantastic job of creating a P2P economy, they also dictate all the rules
        and they control the data of their users.

        In this context, blockchain networks seem to be a driving force of the
        next-generation Internet, what some refer to is the Web3. They reinvent
        the way that data is stored and managed over the Internet, providing a
        unique set of data a universal state layer that is collectively managed
        by all nodes in the network. This unique state layer, for the first
        time, provides a native value settlement layer for the Internet in the
        absence of intermediaries. It enables true P2P transactions, and it all
        started with tie emergence of Bitcoin.

        While the Web2 was a front-end revolution, the Web3 is a backend
        revolution. The Web3 reinvents how the Interne is wired in the backend,
        combining the system functions of the Internet with the system functions
        of computers. However, nothing much wil change on the front-end of the
        Internet for the arerage user. The Web3 represents a set of protocols,
        with distributed ledgers as their backbone. Data is collaboratively
        managed by a P2P network of computers The management rules are
        formalized in the protocol and secured by majority consensus of all
        network participants, who are incentivized with a network token for
        their activities. The protocol formalizes the gorerance rules of the
        network and ensures that people who do not know or trust each other
        reach and settle agreements over the Web. While trying to manipulate
        data on a server resembles treaking into a house, where security is
        provided by a fence and an alarm syster, the Web3 is designed in a way
        that you would need to break into multiple houses around the globe
        simultan-ously, which each have their own fence and alarm system. This
        is possible but prohibitively expensive.
