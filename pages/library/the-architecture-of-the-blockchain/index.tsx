        In a blockchain network, when people exchange tokens, these transactions
        are grouped together into batches called "blocks." Each block contains
        the transactions, a special number called a "nonce," and other details.
        The block is locked with a special code called a "hash," created by a
        cryptographic algorithm. This hash is like a unique fingerprint for the
        block, ensuring that it can't be changed without everyone noticing.
      </FadeInText>
      <FadeInText>Each Block Contains the following:</FadeInText>
      <ul>
        {blockDetails.map((item, i) => (
          <li key={i} className="flex flex-col mb-[2rem]">

              className="text-[1.9rem] capitalize
                         font-semibold"
            >
              {item.title} :
            </p>
            <FadeInText>{item.description}</FadeInText>
          </li>

        Each block includes the hash of the prior block, thereby linking one
        block with another into a chain of blocks. This process guarantees the
        historic integrity of all the blocks back to the first block, also
        referred to as the{" "}
        <span className="font-medium text-color-dark-blue">Genesis block.</span>{" "}
        If data in one block is altered, the hash value of the block and all
        subsequent blocks will change, and every node in the network will know
        that the data has been tampered with.
      </FadeInText>
      <FadeInText className="my-[1rem]">
        This growing list of chained blocks is also referred to as the
        ledger(The Blockchain). The ledger is a file that maintains a growing
        list of transaction records, chained in blocks that are
        cryptographically secured from tampering and revision. If manipulation
        attempts were made, the hash value of the manipulated ledger would not
        coincide with the hash value recorded on the copies of the ledger on all
        other nodes. The hash value of a block therefore serves as a counterfeit
        protection that can be used to check the authenticity of a transaction
        on the blockchain.

        A copy of the ledger(The Blockchain) is stored on multiple
        nodes(Computers) of a cryptographically secured P2P network. In order to
        change the ledger data on all copies of the ledger throughout the whole
        network, the network nodes(computers) need to reach a mutual agreement
        about such a change.
      </FadeInText>
      <FadeInText>
        This process is referred to as "consensus." and will be discussed in
        details in the next chapter using Bitcoin and Ethereum.

        The Blockchain is a shared, trusted, public ledger of transactions that
        everyone can inspect, but which no single user controls. Each
        independent node has the latest version of the ledger, which contains
        all transactions that have ever been made, and can verify transactions.
